# PDFRegexSearch 
## PDFRegexSearch is a simple Python script to search for content within PDF files using Regular Expressions (REGEX). 

### Defining REGEX Patterns
To use the script, you need to define your REGEX patterns directly within the script. 
Open the PDFRegexSearch.py file in your editor, and locate the regex_patterns list. Here you can add your REGEX patterns as strings.
